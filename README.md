# âœˆ Plane.js

![Travis CI Build](https://travis-ci.org/davidrhyswhite/plane.js.svg?branch=master)

A simple, functional, compiles to JavaScript syntax.

### Overview

Plane.js uses only a small number of keywords from JavaScript, namely `if`, `else`, `true` and `false`, strings are represented with a double quote `"` only and numbers work as expected. It's introduced the `fn` keyword for function definitions but this will be removed soon in favour of matching functions based on their `(){}` signature.

### TODO

##### For v1.0.0

- [ ] Block scoping;
- [ ] `()(){}` partially applied closure syntax;
- [ ] Removing `fn` keyword for function definitions;
- [ ] Last expression explicitly returned by default from functions;
- [x] Unix style piping `|` for nested calls, implemented as `|>`;
- [ ] String interpolation;
- [ ] Ability to use the (.) operator;

##### Beyond

- [ ] `import`, `export` syntax;
- [ ] Pattern matching;
- [ ] Array literals using the `[];` declaration;
- [ ] Object literals using the `{};` declaration;
- [ ] `as` keyword for ` import * as named`;
- [ ] `Object` and `Array` left assignment destructuring;
- [ ] Enhanced destructuring with the unary rest operator `...`;
- [ ] Type checking;

## Installation

    npm install -g plane.js

Plain.js exports two versions, the `dist/plain.js` which

## Usage

Once installed you will have access to the `plane` CLI:

    plane run 'negate = fn(value, func) { !func(value) };'

### Node.js / AMD

The Node.js or AMD version is built into the `dist/plain.js`, this exports a single function, when you require this file in with either Node.js or an AMD based environment. Since this is compiled in a UMD format it "should" work as a script within the browser giving you a `plane` function attached to the window object.

* Note you will still need a modern browser with this option as there is no additional transpiling happening.

### Modern browsers

If you're running a modern browser then it makes sense to use the `dist/plain.es.js` version, similarly this exports a single function to pass your script in to be interpreted and run.

Both the `plain.js` and `plain.es.js` versions are distributed with minified

### REPL

Plane.js has a small REPL to test and try scripts in:

    plane repl

## Testing

### Unit

The unit tests are easily runnable with:

    npm test

### Linting

ESLint is running across the project for a consistent style:

    npm run lint

## Why...

### Another syntax?

The intentions of plane.js are to remove many of the constructs of JavaScript and start from scratch with a smaller, cleaner more functional approach. My initial aim was to learn more about lexers and parsers and how programming languages are written in general so I can more easily contribute to the discussions around the future of ECMAScript and understand the difficulties faced (by the TC39 team) adding new constructs / ideas to such a project.

### Plane?

Well the NPM registry is pretty full of decent names these days and I wanted a name signifying that it's a plain / simple almost like syntactically version of JavaScript. As plain.js was taken, I opted for the homonym version of that word.
