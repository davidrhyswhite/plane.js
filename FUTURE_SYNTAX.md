# âœˆ Plane.js syntax

Below are a list of the future proposed syntax for plane.js.

### Native Object and Array's

Currently there is no support for `Object` and `Array` shorthand expressions, once the object or array has been created it is unmutable, no further data or properties can be added.

```javascript
object = {
  prop: "A string property"
};
array = [1, 2, 3];
```

The preceding would be compiled into the following ES6 code:

```javascript
const object = Object.freeze({
  prop: "A string property"
});
const array = Object.freeze([1, 2, 3]);
```

Frozen objects and arrays allow us to create fully un-mutable data types within JavaScript.

### String interpolation

Template strings were a great addition in ES6, but they co course require the additional syntactic sugar of a "\`" back tick character. Plane.js will simplify this allowing interpolation within standard strings, this should negate the need to use the `+` operator to concatenate strings:

```javascript
name = "David";
greeting = "Hello ${name}";
```

### Unless conditional

Plane.js proposes an `unless` statement, this can make for very readable code when the conditional condition follows the expression. Look at the following ES6 code, which should be easily transpilable from an `unless` statement.

```javascript
const number = 10;
const numberIsTen = (number == 10);
if (!numberIsTen) {
  someCode();
};
```

We could write this slightly more elegantly using the `unless` statement:

```javascript
number = 10;
numberIsTen = (number == 10);
unless (numberIsTen) {
  someCode();
};
```

Or reverse the conditional condition and expression, which gives the reader the chance to say 'run someCode unless the numberIsTen', without the need to negate the boolean:

```javascript
{
  someCode();
} unless (numberIsTen);
```

Or take it a step further with a single line, where unless really shines:

```javascript
someCode() unless (numberIsTen);
```

### Functions

The hope of plane.js is to remove many of the JavaScript keywords and instead provide simple, structures to create object, arrays and functions. This means removing the current `fn: Function` keyword in favour of a `(){}` data type.

Many times in JavaScript we like to return a partially applied inner closure, more common within functional programming, plane.js proposes that all function expressions return the last value within that expression, but also proposes a new `()()` closure syntax. Given the following compile JS, it would be good to rewrite that as:

```javascript
const negate = function (func) {
  return function (x) {
    return !func(x);
  };
};
```

Since `(){}` denotes a function declaration, we can safely assume that we will assign a constant named negate a function that takes a single argument to match the preceding JavaScript.

```javascript
negate (func) {
  (x) {
    !func(x);
  };
};
```

We can take this syntax a step further and safely assume `()(){}` is a function that returns another function allowing us to write:

```javascript
negate (func)(x) {
  !func(x);
};
```
